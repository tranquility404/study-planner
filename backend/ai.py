Use the actual subject names

Assign study sessions for each day using the provided availableBlocks, fitting in studyBlockDuration (in minutes).

After each session, add a break of breakDuration (in minutes), except after the final study block.

Do not exceed the dailyTargetStudyHours.

Spread subjects fairly across the week (cycle through them).

Exclude the day marked as offDay.

Show exact study and break times (e.g., "20:00â€“21:30", "21:30â€“21:50").

Return output as a valid JSON array with entries for each day.

No explanation or extra textâ€”only JSON output.
